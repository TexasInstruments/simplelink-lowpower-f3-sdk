The [__{{boardLongName}}__][launchpad] contains a
[__{{deviceName}}__][device] device and several on-board sensors:

* The [__HDC2080__][hdc2080] is an integrated humidity and temperature sensor that provides
  high accuracy measurements with very low power consumption, in a small DFN package
* The [__DRV5055__][drv5055] is a high accuracy 3.3 V or 5 V ratio-metric bipolar hall effect
  sensor that responds proportionally to magnetic flux density. The device can be used for
  accurate position sensing in a  wide range of applications.
* The [__ADXL362__][adxl362] is an ultralow power, 3-axis MEMS accelerometer that consumes
  less than 2 Î¼A at a 100 Hz output data rate and 270 nA when in motion triggered wake-up mode,
* The [__OPT3001__][opt3001] is a sensor that measures the intensity of visible light.
  The spectral response of the sensor tightly matches the photopic response of the human eye
  and includes significant infrared rejection.
