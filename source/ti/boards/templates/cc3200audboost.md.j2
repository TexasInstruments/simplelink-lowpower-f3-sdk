### [__CC3200 Audio BoosterPack__][cc3200audboost]

{% if mod == "mod_din_dout_bclk_wclk" %}
The BoostPack's `DIN`, `DOUT`, `BCLK` and `FSYNC`/`WCLK` signal pins are not
compatible with this LaunchPad. Use the following modifications to enable the
CC3200 Audio BoosterPack's usage with the __i2secho__ example.

On the {{boardName}} board, bend down the following BoosterPack header pins:

* `BP.26`
* `BP.27`
* `BP.28`
* `BP.29`
* `BP.30`

Be sure that the bent pins do not make contact with the IC or any other
component, bend them enough to make sure they don't connect to the CC3200
Audio BoosterPack.

Attach the CC3200 Audio BoosterPack to the {{boardName}} and run jumper wires
between the following pins on the CC3200 Audio BoosterPack:

* DIN: `P3.3` and `P3.9`
* DOUT: `P3.4` and `P3.10`
* BCLK: `P3.5` and `P3.8`
* FSYNC/WCLK: `P4.9` and `P3.7`

See [Audio BP User Guide][cc3200audboost-user-guide] (Figure 2-1), or the diagram
below, for information on where these pins are located.
