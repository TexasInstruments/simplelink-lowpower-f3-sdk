 @file  ctrl_stub_health_check.h

 @brief This file contains prototype of default stub implementations for the
        feature wrapper functions.
        These weak placeholder implementations do nothing by default,
        allowing the feature to remain disabled without causing any issues in
        the build process.
        When the feature is enabled, these stubs are replaced by the actual
        implementations directed by ctrl_health_check.c.

 Group: WCS, BTS
 Target Device: cc23xx
