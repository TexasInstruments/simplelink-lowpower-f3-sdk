gives the peripheral device some flexibility. If the peripheral does not have \
any data to send, it can skip connection events, stay asleep, and save power. \
The peripheral device selects whether to wake or not on a per connection \
event basis. The peripheral can skip connection events but must not skip more \
than allowed by the peripheral latency parameter or the connection fails.\n
