Pairing Mode | Description
--- | ---
Pairing is not allowed | With pairing mode set to \`GAPBOND_PAIRING_MODE_NO_PAIRING\`, \
the BLE stack automatically rejects any attempt at pairing.
Wait for a pairing request | The Peripheral can be configured to wait for a Pairing Request \
from the Central when the pairing mode is set to \`GAPBOND_PAIRING_MODE_WAIT_FOR_REQ\`. \
When this pairing mode is selected, the GAPBondMgr will automatically respond with a \
Pairing Response based on other GAPBondMgr configured parameters.
Initiate a pairing request | To initiate the pairing process on Peripheral role devices, \
\`GAPBOND_PAIRING_MODE_INITIATE\` will send a Peripheral Security Request shortly after the \
GAPBondMgr is informed that the connection is formed. For Central role devices, \
\`GAPBOND_PAIRING_MODE_INITIATE\` will send a Pairing Request or request the Link Layer \
to encrypt the link if the device has previously paired/bonded.

This parameter has no effect when the application specifies the keys using the \`GAPBOND_ECC_KEYS\` \

by 1, but if the pairing fails the count is decremented by 3. The specification recommends that \
this value be set to no higher than 10 to avoid an attacker from learning too much about a \
