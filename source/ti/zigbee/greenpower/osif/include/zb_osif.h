/**
@par OS/HW abstraction
OS/HW platform abstraction is necessary to achieve high portability.
C language tool to separate abstraction layer is C preprocessor.

Main idea is to avoid number of ifdefs related to portability in the code, and
decrease number of ifdefs in the header files not related to the OS abstraction
layer.

Platform abstraction is implemented as C functions placed into OS abstraction
layers and platform-dependent global typedefs and definitions placed into header
files.  All platform-related stuff is in osif/ directory.  Global definitions
and typedefs can be used anywhere - that is why on the architecture picture OS
abstraction layer depicted as global.

Following things are platform-dependent:
*   typedefs for base types (8-bit controller vs 32-bit Linux device)
*   definitions for different 8051 compilers (SDCC and Keil)
*   transceiver i/o (interrupts handling for 8051 vs file i/o in Linux);
*   wait for i/o (device sleep for 8051, wait in select() in Linux)
*   trace i/o (UART for 8051, file in Linux);
*   MAC traffic dump (UART for 8051, file in Linux);
*   Timer (8051 timer at device, select() timeout in Linux)
