 *  @brief      ECDSA HSM IP driver implementation for the Low Power F3 family
 *
 *  This file should only be included in the board file to fill the ECDSA_config
 *  struct.
 *
 *  # Hardware and Implementation Details #
 *
 *  The driver is backed by a software ECC library implementation.
 *
 *  # Supported Curves #
 *
 *  The driver implementation supports the following curves for ECDSA:
 *
 *  | Curves Supported |
 *  |------------------|
 *  | NISTP256         |
 *  | NISTP224         |
 *  | NISTP2384        |
 *  | NISTP521         |
 *  | BRP256           |
 *  | BRP384           |
 *  | BRP512           |
