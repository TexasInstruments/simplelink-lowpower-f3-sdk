 *
 *  @brief      Mutex module for the RTOS Porting Interface
 *
 *  The MutexP module allows tasks to maintain critical region segments. The
 *  MutexP module has two main functions: ::MutexP_lock and ::MutexP_unlock.
 *
 *  The MutexP module supports recursive calls to the MutexP_lock API by a
 *  single task. The same number of MutexP_unlock calls must be done for the
 *  mutex to be release. Note: the returned key must be provided in the LIFO
 *  order. For example:
 *  @code
 *  uintptr_t key1, key2;
 *  key1 = MutexP_lock();
 *  key2 = MutexP_lock();
 *  MutexP_unlock(key2);
 *  MutexP_unlock(key1);
 *  @endcode
 *
