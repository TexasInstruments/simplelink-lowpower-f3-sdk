 *
 *  @brief      RNG driver implementation for the LPF3 family
 *
 *  This file should only be included in the board file to fill the RNG_config
 *  structure.
 *
 *  This is a temporary RNG implementation that uses a constant seed to derive
 *  random numbers. This implementation will be updated to HSM's TRNG to
 *  seed the RNG driver.
 *
 *  @note This implementation does not support the RNG_RETURN_BEHAVIOR_CALLBACK
 *        return mode.
 *
 *  @note This implementation treats RNG_RETURN_BEHAVIOR_POLLING as
 *        RNG_RETURN_BEHAVIOR_BLOCKING.
 */

/* !!!!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!!
 * RNG driver is non-functional on CC27CC devices, as it uses a constant seed.
