 *  @brief      CC27XX specific ITM implementation
 *
 *  This file should only be included in the board file to fill out the object
 *  and hwAttrs structures
 *
 *  # CC27XX specific members #
 *  The CC27XX is capable of treating the pins used by the SWO interface as
 *  GPIOs. This means that the pins must be managed by the ITM driver when not
 *  in use by the TPIU.
