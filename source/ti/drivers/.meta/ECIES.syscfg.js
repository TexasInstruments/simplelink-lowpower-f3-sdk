The [__ECIES driver__][1] driver provides a public-key encryption scheme based
on Elliptic Curve Cryptography. It uses the NIST P-256 Elliptic Curve to generate
a shared secret which is used as an input for ANSI X9.36 Key Derivation Function
(KDF) to derive the key and IV for authenticated encryption using AES-128-GCM.
