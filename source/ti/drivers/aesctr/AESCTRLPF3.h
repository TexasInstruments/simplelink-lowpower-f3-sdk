 *
 *  @brief      AESCTR driver implementation for the Low Power F3 family
 *
 * # Hardware Accelerator #
 * The Low Power F3 family of devices has dedicated hardware accelerators.
 * CC23XX devices have one dedicated accelerator whereas CC27XX devices have two
 * (Primary and Secondary). Combined they can perform AES encryption operations with
 * 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit keys. Only one operation can be carried out on the
 * accelerator at a time. Mutual exclusion is implemented at the driver level and
 * coordinated between all drivers relying on the accelerator. It is transparent to
 * the application and only noted to ensure sensible access timeouts are set.
 *
 *  # Implementation Limitations
 *  - Only plaintext CryptoKeys are supported by this implementation.
 *
 *  # Runtime Parameter Validation #
 *  The driver implementation does not perform runtime checks for most input parameters.
 *  Only values that are likely to have a stochastic element to them are checked (such
 *  as whether a driver is already open). Higher input parameter validation coverage is
 *  achieved by turning on assertions when compiling the driver.
