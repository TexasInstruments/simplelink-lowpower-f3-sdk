       1. The device SHALL not attach nor process any TLVs
       2. The device SHALL not support NWK commissioning Request/Response
       3. The device SHALL not add beacon appendix to the beacon
       4. The device shall not support APSME relay upstream/downstream commands.
       5. Node descriptor SHALL respond with legacy payload and no TLVs the server mask may be 23.
       6. Support Pre-configured keys and only supports TCLK. 
       7. Disable all new ZDO servers and respond with NOT_SUPPORTED default response.
