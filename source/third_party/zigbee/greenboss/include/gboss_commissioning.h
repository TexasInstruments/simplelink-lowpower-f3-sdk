 * @brief Does one step of unidirectional commissioning, or decommissions
 * if a device was marked as "commissioned".
 *
 * GreenBOSS supposes that unidirectional commissioning is used at
 * battery-less devices, so it's likely that the GPD doesn't have enough power to perform
 * anything after that function return.
 *
 * With unidirectional commissioning GreenBOSS marks device as "commissioned"
 * at transmitting first application packet (GPD command), like GBOSS_CMD_ON(),
 * after gboss_unidir_commissioning_step() was called 1 or more times.
