# SIMPLELINK LOW POWER F3 SDK
This repository contains TI's SimpleLink Low Power F3 Software Development Kit (SDK).

### Special Notice for CC2340R5

#### CC2340R5: Recommended IAR version for F3 SDK 7.40.00.64
IAR Embedded Workbench users are recommend to use IAR 9.40.2 with F3 SDK 7.40.00.64. This information has not been properly reported in the release notes of the SDK.

Using previous IAR versions may lead to issue during the launch of debugging sessions.

So far, no issue have been reported while using newer IAR versions (such as 9.50.2).

## Summary

The SimpleLink™ Low Power F3 Software Development Kit provides a comprehensive software package for developing 2.4 GHz applications, including support for Bluetooth® Low and proprietary RF solutions on the SimpleLink CC23xx wireless MCUs.

An overview of the full SDK is hosted on TI Resource Explorer.

## Background
This repository contains a subset of TI's [SimpleLink Low Power F3 SDK](https://www.ti.com/tool/SIMPLELINK-LOWPOWER-SDK).  It is provided via a Git repo to meet several use cases, including:

* Reduces download size
* Enables CI/CD tooling to use Git rather than installers
* Increases visibility of changes, better enabling benefit/risk assessments
* Simplifies the workflow for rebasing user changes to different releases

It intentionally omits documentation (the **docs/** directory) and examples (**examples/**) to reduce size.  Regarding those omissions:

* [Documentation is available online](https://dev.ti.com/tirex/explore/node?node=A__AJE8rC9SSzb3kRUd2VMM9w__com.ti.SIMPLELINK_LOWPOWER_F3_SDK__58mgN04__LATEST&placeholder=true).  Please match your git version to the documentation version in the TI Developer Zone.
* Examples are available in separate repositories, as noted in [Examples](#example-repos).

## Features


- Industry leading Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) software protocol stack supporting Bluetooth 5.3 (learn more [TI.com/ble](https://www.ti.com/ble))
- Support for Proprietary 2.4 GHz applications supporting basic RX and TX examples


## Example Repos

- [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/simplelink-ble5stack-examples)
- [Proprietary RF](https://github.com/TexasInstruments/simplelink-prop_rf-examples)


## Setup Instructions

### Edit **imports.mak**
The imports.mak file, located at the root of the SDK, is a generic sample and will not work out of the box.   Please update imports.mak with the tools (compilers, cmake, etc.) paths installed on your system.

For a Linux build, settings must be updated to match your build system's setup.  The only outlier may be Python, as most python3.6+ interpreters will work.  Please note cmake must be 3.21+, or the builds will fail.  If using CCS ccs1220, the SysConfig installed is incompatible with the SDKs.  Either upgrade to the latest CCS or install SysConfig 1.17.0 from [https://www.ti.com/tool/SYSCONFIG](https://www.ti.com/tool/SYSCONFIG).  See [Resources](#resources) for URL's of tools that need installation to build the SDKs and examples.

By default TICLANG and GCC toolchains are enabled.  If a toolchain is not needed, unset the compiler, for example, `GCC_ARMCOMPILER ?=`.

### Default imports.mak

`SYSCONFIG_TOOL`         ?= /home/username/ti/CCS_Install/ccs/utils/sysconfig_1.17.0/sysconfig_cli.sh

`FREERTOS_INSTALL_DIR`   ?= /home/username/FreeRTOSv202104.00

`CMAKE`                  ?= /home/username/cmake-3.21.3/bin/cmake

`PYTHON`                 ?= python3

`TICLANG_ARMCOMPILER`    ?= /home/username/ti/CCS_Install/ccs/tools/compiler/ti-cgt-armllvm_2.1.3.LTS-0

`GCC_ARMCOMPILER`        ?= /home/username/ti/CCS_Install/ccs/tools/compiler/9.2019.q4.major-0

Edit **imports.mak** and update all dependencies to reflect your paths.

Notably for Windows users, the _Windows_ variant of some tools may be required.
For example, the `SYSCONFIG_TOOL` will need to have a **.bat** extension.

## Build SDK Libraries
SDK libraries must exist before building any examples.  After editing imports.mak, build SDK libraries from the root  of the SDK (the same directory where imports.mak resides) by:

$ `make`

The make will go through the SDK and build all libraries.  Depending on the build machine, the make will run for a few minutes.
